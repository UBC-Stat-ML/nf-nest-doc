## Overview

You will need to go through these setup instructions before using nf-nest. 
This needs to be done only once per user and per cluster.  


## Allocation code 

In some HPC such as UBC Sockeye, we need an allocation code to 
submit to the job queue. 
Scripts in nf-nest use an ENV variable called `ALLOCATION_CODE` to 
find the allocation code. 

To set the variable in your current session, use:

```{bash}
export ALLOCATION_CODE=my-alloc-code
```

To automatically set this variable for next time you login:

```bash
echo "export ALLOCATION_CODE=my-alloc-code" >> ~/.bashrc
```
