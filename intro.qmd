## Context

Large scale numerical experiments are central to much of contemporary scientific and mathematical research. Performing these numerical experiments in a valid, reproducible and scalable fashion is not easy. 


## Goal

This repository documents `nf-nest` a suite of utilities to help you succeed in your 
numerical experimental campaigns. 


## Technology stack

`nf-nest` uses the following open source projects:

- Nextflow: can be thought of as an "operating system" for coordinating numerical experiments. 
- Julia: a programming language to unlock full access to high performance computation on both CPUs and GPUs. 

While some features of `nf-nest` are Julia specific, other parts are language agnostic. 


## Background

### Scientific workflow

A scientific workflow is a directed acyclic graph where each node is a process and each edge 
between node $n$ to $n'$
denote that at least one output of process $n$ is fed as an input to process $n'$. 

TODO: prototype example (preprocess / precompile / run array of exeriments / combine / plot) / figure

TODO: mention benefits - job submission of each node at right time, file system issues, retries, repro, etc
