This is called “activating” an environment.\n\nInteractive Julia package manager\nThe most common method is to use the interactive Julia package manager. To start it, type ] followed by enter.\nActivating is done with the activate keyword.\nYou can then add a package using the add command. The argument of add can be either a registered Julia package, as in:\nENV[\"JULIA_PKG_PRECOMPILE_AUTO\"]=0 # Hold off precompile since we are in login node\n]\nactivate experiment_repo/julia_env\nadd Pigeons\nor it can be a git repository, optionally with a specific commit/tag:\nadd Example@0.5\nadd Example#master\nadd Example#c37b675\nadd https://github.com/JuliaLang/Example.jl#master\nadd git@github.com:JuliaLang/Example.jl.git\nadd \"git@github.com:JuliaLang/Example.jl.git\"#master\nadd https://github.com/Company/MonoRepo:juliapkgs/Package.jl\nTo exit the interactive Julia package manager, type control-C.\n\n\nProgrammatic interface\nAlternatively, a programmatic interface is also available for scripting:\n\nENV[\"JULIA_PKG_PRECOMPILE_AUTO\"]=0 # Hold off precompile since we are in login node\nusing Pkg \nPkg.activate(\"experiment_repo/julia_env\")\nPkg.add(\"Pigeons\")",
