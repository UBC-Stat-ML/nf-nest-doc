## Overview

We use the term "experiment repo" for a git repository that 
contains the plumbing required for a numerical experiment. 

It consists in a git repository with:

- the `nextflow` executable and its configuration, `nextflow.config`;
- a git submodule, `nf-nest` containing useful tools; 
- your `.nf` files and other supporting files. 

This pages explains how to setup an experiment repo.
